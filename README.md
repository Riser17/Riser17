### Hi there! 👋

I'm Harshvardhan Rathore, a passionate software developer with a strong foundation in web and mobile technologies. My expertise lies in crafting efficient and scalable solutions using various tools and frameworks.

#### Tech Stack:

- **React Native:** Building cross-platform mobile applications that deliver a native-like experience.
- **React:** Developing interactive and responsive user interfaces for web applications.
- **Node.js:** Backend development for creating robust and scalable server-side applications.
- **HTML & CSS:** Crafting clean, visually appealing front-end code for seamless user experiences.
- **JavaScript:** Proficient in both front-end and back-end JavaScript development.

#### What I'm Currently Up To:

- HealthyHabitApp: This project is a mobile application developed using React Native for the RevenueCat Ship-a-Ton hackathon. The app is designed to help users track and improve their daily habits, including monitoring their steps, distance walked, and flights climbed. The app also includes features like BMI calculation and graphical representation of habits such as drinking water, taking breaks, and walking.

- 📷 Snap-camera: This project is a React Native-based Snapchat Camera Clone. The app provides various camera tools, such as zoom, flash, and torch options, and allows users to capture and filter images with ease.
  
- 🏠 Airbnb Clone React Native app: It's a project aimed at replicating the functionalities of Airbnb, allowing users to browse listings, view detailed property pages, and utilize features such as map view and user authentication.
  
- 🔴 Working on building the Go Live app, a live streaming platform designed to enable users to broadcast live video content to their audience in real-time. It provides a seamless and intuitive interface for streamers to start broadcasting with just a few clicks, allowing viewers to engage with the content through live comments and reactions.

- 👟 Working on a Nike Clone React Native app – This project is a React Native application that serves as a clone of a Nike product catalog and shopping cart system. The app allows users to browse a list of Nike products, view individual product details with a carousel, and add products to a shopping cart. The shopping cart also displays a list of items with options to increase or decrease quantities.

- 🏥  Working on HealthCare Solution app Project – Healthcare application that aims to provide users with easy and convenient access to medical services. This app allows users to search for healthcare providers in their area, book appointments with doctors, and access their medical records.

In short, HealthCare Solution is a powerful healthcare platform that offers a range of services to users, with the API enabling developers to take advantage of its features and build custom applications that leverage its functionality.
- 💬 Open to collaboration and exploring new opportunities in the tech world.
