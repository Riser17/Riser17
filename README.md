- 👟 Working on a Nike Clone React Native app – This project is a React Native application that serves as a clone of a Nike product catalog and shopping cart system. The app allows users to browse a list of Nike products, view individual product details with a carousel, and add products to a shopping cart. The shopping cart also displays a list of items with options to increase or decrease quantities.
